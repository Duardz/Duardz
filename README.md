# Hey, I'm Duardz ðŸ‘‹

I love building things with AI and turning silly ideas into actual apps. Most of my projects start with "wouldn't it be funny if..." and somehow end up as fully functional websites that people actually use.

## What I'm working on

**Love Survival Kit** - A relationship quiz game where every answer is wrong but somehow that's the point. Built with SvelteKit during way too many late nights fueled by coffee and questionable life choices.

**Saint Patrick's Academy Inc. Website** - Currently developing an enrollment and informational website for the academy. Using AI for code generation to build something that actually helps students and families navigate the enrollment process. This one's more serious than my usual chaos, but still built with the same "ship it and iterate" energy.

## Past Projects

**Power Zone** - Gym management system that handles member registration, class scheduling, and trainer coordination for a local fitness center. Turns out gyms need software that actually works, so this one had to be bulletproof.

**Papa Jun's POS** - Point-of-sale system for restaurants. Currently a beautiful frontend demo while I figure out how to make Firebase do exactly what I want without breaking everything.

## Current vibe

Building random stuff, breaking things, fixing them, then breaking them again. Usually with help from Claude AI at 2am when my brain stops working but my hands keep typing. I've learned to embrace the cycle of "this will definitely work" â†’ "why is everything on fire" â†’ "oh wait, I forgot a semicolon."

## How I work

I'm big on using AI as a coding partner - not to replace thinking, but to handle the boring stuff so I can focus on solving actual problems. Claude helps me write cleaner code faster, debug weird issues, and occasionally talks me out of terrible architectural decisions.

My development philosophy is pretty simple: ship it before you overthink it, then improve it based on real feedback. Perfect code that never ships helps nobody.

## Tech I actually use

**Languages & Frameworks:** JavaScript, SvelteKit, HTML, CSS, and whatever else gets the job done without making me want to throw my laptop out the window.

**Tools & Services:** Firebase for when I need a backend that just works, Vercel for hosting because deployments should be boring, Tailwind CSS because life's too short to write custom CSS for everything.

**AI Partners:** Claude for code generation, debugging, and late-night rubber duck conversations. GitHub Copilot when I need autocomplete that reads my mind.

## Things I believe

- Code should solve real problems for real people
- Shipping something imperfect is better than perfecting something that never ships
- AI is a tool, not a replacement for understanding what you're building
- Good documentation is a love letter to your future self
- Git commit messages should tell a story (even if it's a tragic one)

## Find me

Usually working on code, pretending to understand git, or explaining to someone why their "simple" feature request will require rebuilding half the application.

You can catch me building in public, breaking things in private, and occasionally sharing what I've learned along the way.
