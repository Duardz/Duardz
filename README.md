# Hey, I'm Duardz ðŸ‘‹

I love building things with AI and turning silly ideas into actual apps.

## What I'm working on

**Love Survival Kit** - A relationship quiz game where every answer is wrong but somehow that's the point. Built with SvelteKit and way too many late nights.

## Current vibe

Building random stuff, breaking things, fixing them, then breaking them again. Usually with help from Claude AI at 2am.

## Tech I use

JavaScript, SvelteKit, CSS, and whatever else gets the job done.

## Find me

Working on code or pretending to understand git.
